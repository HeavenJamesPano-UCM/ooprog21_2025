/*
Bugs:
1. Wrong class name in the first line because it was written as "FixDebug One" with a space, it should be "FixDebugOne".
2. Wrong method name in the third line because it was written as "Main" with capital M, it should be lowercase "main".
3. Also wrong parameter in the third line because it was written as (String args), it should be (String[] args).
4. Wrong in the fourth line because "Systm" was misspelled, it should be "System", and also a semicolon (;) was missing at the end.
5. Closing bracket was missing at the end of the program.
